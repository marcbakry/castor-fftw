Castor FFTW
+++++++++++

The library **Castor FFTW** aims at extending the `castor project <http://leprojetcastor.gitlab.labos.polytechnique.fr/castor/>`_ by providing a simple Matlab-like interface to the well-known `FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`_ library. While the **castor** project provides natively functions for the computation of Fast Fourier Transforms, based on the `KISSFFT library <https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft>`_, only the ``float`` number precision is supported. The **Castor FFTW** library support both precisions and should be much faster but requires the FFTW3 to be installed.

**Licensing:** the code for **Castor FFTW** is provided under the *MIT license*. Please be careful that it is not the case for the FFTW3 which is provided under the GPL3.0.
